## Before Starting 
you will need to download Anaconda with python 3.  This includes python 3 along with many great packages used in data analysis. 
Follow the link to download: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Download and Run
First click the green "clone/download" button in the top right of the repository.  Once you've downloaded the repository, find the full path of the script and paste it into a text editor. Then, on the next line, write pause.  This will keep the command prompt open so you can read the log in case there are any errors.
```
C:\some\directory\file.py
pause
```
Save the file as a .txt, then find the file on your computer.  Replace .txt with .bat.  Double click the .bat file and the program will run.
